**Beginnings**  
As mentioned, I have been taking photographs for years. I started taking photos with my iPhone in middle school because I really liked the way the sunrise looked on my way to school. After taking photos for awhile, I was gifted a camera my sophomore year of high school. It was a [Nikon D3400](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product-archive/dslr-cameras/d3400.html) my dad had bought during Black Friday.   

I used this camera a lot, especially since I was involved in clubs that had me take photos for them. The D3400 has its limitations for sure. This is very apparent when shooting sports in any lighting that was not daytime. The ISO range on the camera was fine, but anything higher than 400 introduced grain. After awhile, I realized that I needed to upgrade.  

I looked through various cameras, but I was particularly drawn to the Fujifilm series due to their filtering and color retention. I was also heavily inspired by a photographer on Instagram called [JetJaguar](https://www.instagram.com/jetjaguar/). I really loved the way his colors looked and how he was able to create both strong contrast and soft images with plenty of color. As such, I bought myself a [Fujifilm XT-3](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-t3/).

I used this camera a lot. It basically was used for most of my photography career in high school and college. It was not until this past winter that I bought the Fujifilm XT-5 because of new, in body stabilization. By then, I already had quite a few lenses and was ready to go take photos. The XT-5 is the camera that took the Kamakura photo I showed on the home page.

Here is a comparison of photos from each camera[^1]:
